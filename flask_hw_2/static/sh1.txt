Harry: Cheryl. Where could you be? It's strange... It's quiet. Too quiet. This place is like a ghost town.
Harry: Footsteps?
Harry: Cheryl? Is that Cheryl!? Where are you going?
Harry: Hey, wait... Stop!
Harry: ......better than nothing, I guess.
Harry: What is this? What is going on here!?
Harry: Was I dreaming?
Officer: How do you feel?
Harry: Like I've been run over by a truck, but I'm alright, I guess.
Officer: Glad to hear it. You from around here? Why don't you tell me what happened?
Harry: Wait a second. I'm just a tourist. I came here for a vacation. I just got here... I don't know what happened. I'd like to find out myself.
Officer: Uh-huh?
Harry: Have you seen a little girl? Just turned seven last month... Short, black hair... My daughter.
Cybil: Sorry. The only person I've seen in this town is you.
Harry: Where is everybody?
Officer: I'd tell you if I knew, believe me. But from what I can tell, something bizarre is going on. That's all I know.
Harry: Hmmm...
Cybil: What's your name?
Harry: Harry... Harry Mason.
Officer: Cybil Bennett. I'm a police officer from Brahms, the next town over. The phones are all dead, and the radio, too. I'm going back to call in some reinforcements.
Harry: Hmph.
Cybil: Hold it! Where do you think you're going?
Harry: My daughter... I've gotta find her.
Cybil: No way! It's dangerous out there.
Harry: In that case, I need to find her now! Cheryl's my little girl. I can't just leave her by herself.
Cybil: Have you got a gun?
Harry: Ummm... no.
Cybil: Take this. And hope you don't have to use it.
Cybil: Now listen to me, before you pull the trigger, know who you're shooting. And don't do it unless you have to. And don't go blasting me by mistake. Got it?
Harry: Yeah. Thanks.
Cybil: You'd do best to stay near by. I'll be back with help as quick as I can.
Harry: What's that? Huh? Radio? What's going on with that radio?
Harry: This is not a dream! What's happening to this place!?
Harry: Where could Cheryl have gone? I guess I'll check that alley again.
Harry: Isn't this Cheryl's sketchbook? Hmmm... She's at the school.
Harry: What? It's getting dark again? What's going on!?
Harry: Just a cat...
Harry: Where am I? Have I been here before?
Harry: I don't remember this being here before...
Voice: Daddy---- help me!---------Daddy----where are you----?
Harry: Cheryl!
Harry: That was Cheryl's voice. I know it. Where is she? Cheryl...
Harry: What?
Harry: That light!?
Harry: Huh? What was that!? Who in the hell was that!? Where am I? This is a... boiler room? What's going on here?
Harry: I hear a... a church bell, maybe. Where is it coming from? Who's ringing that bell?
Harry: Were you ringing that bell?
Woman: I've been expecting you. It was fortold by Gyromancy.
Harry: What are you talking about?
Woman: I knew you'd come. You want the girl, right?
Harry: The girl!? You're talking about Cheryl!?
Woman: I see everything.
Harry: You know something? Tell me!
Woman: Stay back! Nothing's to be gained from floundering about at random. You must follow the path. The path of the Hermit can seal by Flauros.
Harry: What!? What are you talking about?
Woman: Here, the Flauros, a cage of piece. It can break through the walls of darkness and counteract the wrath of the underworld. These will help you. Make haste to the hospital before it's too late.
Harry: Wait! Don't go yet.
Harry: Hold it! Stop! Don't shoot.
Harry: Wait... I'm not here to fight. My name is Harry Mason. I'm in town on vacation.
Man: Thank God. Another human being.
Harry: Do you work here?
Man: I'm Doctor Michael Kaufmann. I work at this hospital.
Harry: So maybe you can tell me what's going on.
Kaufmann: I really can't say. I was taking a nap in this staff room. When I woke up, it was like this. Everyone seems to have disappeared. And it's snowing out, this time of year. Something's gone seriously wrong. Did you see those monsters? Have you ever seen such aberrations? Ever even heard of such things? You and I both know creatures like that don't exist.
Harry: Yeah. Have you seen a little girl anywhere? I'm looking for my daughter. She's only seven. Short. Black hair.
Kaufmann: She's missing? I'm sorry. But with all those monsters around, I highly doubt that she's...
Harry: 
Kaufmann: Sorry, I didn't mean to alarm you. Your wife, she's here with you?
Harry: She died four years ago. Now it's just me and my daughter.
Kaufmann: I see. I'm sorry. Well, I'd better be going. I can't just sit around here doing nothing.
Nurse: Finally, someone else who's OK.
Harry: Who are you?
Nurse: My name's Lisa Garland. What's yours?
Harry: Harry Mason.
Lisa: Harry, tell me what's happening here. Where is everybody? I must have gotten knocked out. When I came to, everyone was gone. It's awful.
Harry: So you don't know anything either. Great... I just don't get it. It's like this all is some kind of bad dream.
Lisa: Yeah, a living nightmare.
Harry: Let me ask you, have you seen a little girl around here? Short. Black hair. Seven years old.
Lisa: A seven year old girl. What, she's your daughter?
Harry: Yes.
Lisa: A seven year old girl. I can't say that I have. I was unconscious all this time. I'm sorry.
Harry: That's all right. Do you know anything about all that weird stuff in the basement?
Lisa: No. Why? Is there something down there?
Harry: You don't know? Don't you work here?
Lisa: We're under strict orders never to enter the basement storeroom. So I really don't know. What did you say was down there?
Harry: Well, it's...
Harry: UPH... DAMN! My head!
Lisa: What's wrong? Harry? Harry. Let me help you. Harry... 
Harry: Was I dreaming?
Woman: You were too late.
Harry: It's you.
Woman: Yes. Dahlia Gillespie.
Harry: Tell me everything you know. What's going on?
Dahlia: Darkness. The town is being devoured by darkness. Strength must overcome petty desire. Childish sleep talk. I knew this day would come.
Harry: What are you talking about? I don't understand a word of this.
Dahlia: Believe the evidence of your eyes. The other church in this town, that is your destination. This is beyond my abilities. Only you can stop it now. Have you not seen the crest mark on the ground all over town?
Harry: So that's what I saw in the schoolyard. What does it mean?
Dahlia: It is the mark of Samael. Don't let it be completed.
Harry: Hey, wait!
Harry: What's this?
Cybil: Harry!
Harry: Cybil?
Cybil: I'm glad you're okay. I shouldn't've left you. Things are worse than I thought. It's nuts!
Harry: What are you doing here? I thought you left town.
Cybil: I saw you go in here, so I followed you. I couldn't get out! All the roads out of town are blocked. Cars have completely stopped running. The phones and radios are still out, too.
Harry: What about my daughter? Did you see her?
Cybil: I did see a girl.
Harry: Was it Cheryl?
Cybil: I only caught a glimpse of her through the fog. I went after her, but she vanished! I don't know about your daughter, but...
Harry: And you just let her go!? Where was it?
Cybil: On Bachman Road. She was heading towards the lake. Now don't get excited, it wasn't like she ran off exactly. There was no place for her to go. The road has been obliterated.
Harry: What? So then Cheryl...
Cybil: It was like she was walking on thin air.
Harry: Hmm...?
Cybil: What about you? Anything?
Harry: Yeah. I met this bizarre woman. Her name is Dahlia Gillespie. Do you know her?
Cybil: Dahlia Gillespie. No. And?
Harry: She said something about the town being devoured by darkness. Gibberish like that. Any idea what it means?
Cybil: Darkness devouring the town? Must be on drugs. They sell 'em to the tourists. The force still can't figure out who's behind it. None of our leads have panned out, and the investigation is stalled.
Harry: What could drug trafficking have to do with all this?
Cybil: Hmm... I really don't know. But maybe that's the darkness she was talking about. That's all I can think of.
Harry: Hmm...
Cybil: What's this?
Harry: Just discovered it. Maybe there's something back there.
Cybil: Let's have a look.
Harry: Wait! We don't know what's back there. I'd better check it out first.
Cybil: I'm a cop, I should go.
Harry: No! I'm going.
Cybil: All right. I'll cover you from here. Be careful. If anything looks fishy, get back here on the double.
Harry: Okay. Cybil?
Cybil: Yeah?
Harry: Do you know anything about, well... like some other world? It's like some kind of bad dream.
Cybil: What are you talking about?
Harry: I'm not quite sure. I try to make sense of it, but then my mind goes blank. Everything's dark there, and I hear sirens in the distance. I met this nurse, Lisa. It's like I was there, but not really. It's all a blur. Like some kind of hallucination. You know?
Cybil: I have no idea what you're talking about, Harry.
Harry: Oh... I was just wondering. Never mind.
Cybil: Harry, you're tired.
Harry: Yeah. Maybe.
Harry: What's this...? Some kind of altar...? Never see anything like this before. Maybe this is the "other" church.
Harry: Huh! What the!?
Cybil: Harry? Are you okay?
Cybil: Harry? Harry... 
Harry: Where am I? Lisa? Then I'm at the hospital?
Lisa: You were having a bad dream.
Harry: Was I? Hey, you don't look too good. Are you okay?
Lisa: I'm fine. Nothing you need to worry about.
Harry: Well, if you're sure. Lisa. Do you know a woman named Dahlia Gillespie?
Lisa: Oh yeah, that crazy Gillespie lady. She's kind of famous around here. She never sees anybody, so I don't know that much about her. But, I heard her kid died in a fire and supposedly she's been crazy ever since.
Harry: Well, she says the town is being devoured by "the darkness". Do you have any idea what she's talking about?
Lisa: The town devoured by the darkness... Yes, I think I do. Before this place was turned into a resort, the townspeople here were on the quiet side. Everybody followed some kind of queer religion. Weird occult stuff. Black Magic, that kind of thing. As the young people moved away, the people figured they'd been summoned by the Gods. Evidently, things like that used to happen around here all the time. Before the resort, there wasn't really anything else out here. Everyone was so flipped out. Gotta blame it on something. Then a lot of new people came in and everybody clammed up about it.
Harry: Occult...
Lisa: Last time I heard anything about it was...gosh, years ago. When several people connected with developing the town died in accidents. People said it was a curse. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm rambling. I'll shut up.
Harry: Was that another dream? Did I pass out again?
Cheryl: Daddy----help me!---------Daddy----where are you?----
Harry: Cheryl!
Lisa: Harry!
Harry: Glad you're ok.
Lisa: Thank God you came back! I was scared to be here all alone!
Harry: I'm here now. I was worried, too. I'm real happy to see you. Lisa, can you tell me how to get to the lake?
Lisa: The lake? You take Bachman Road.
Harry: The road's blocked.
Lisa: Well, that's the only way out there.
Harry: Are you sure? There's gotta be another way.
Lisa: WAIT, I just remembered something!
Harry: What?
Lisa: There's a water works over by my old elementary school. It's been abandoned for years. There's an underground tunnel out there used for inspections or something. I remember hearing it runs all the way to the lake.
Harry: Really? You think I can get to the lake from there?
Lisa: I've never been down in there myself, so I'm not positive. Besides, it's all fenced off to keep people out.
Harry: If there's a chance, I've got to try.
Lisa: Harry, don't go! I don't want to be alone. It's so scary. I can't stand it!
Harry: How about coming with me? This may not be the safest place in the world, either. I can't promise you anything, but I'll do my best to protect you.
Lisa: No... somehow I feel I'm not supposed to leave this place. Oh, Harry, I'm so scared... I'm cold.
Harry: Look, just wait here a little longer. I'll be back as soon as I find my daughter.
Lisa: Harry...
Harry: What?
Harry: That light!?
Harry: Are you OK?
Kaufmann: Yeah, I guess so. But I'm beat. I thought I was a goner there. So, how'd it go? Did you find a way out?
Harry: No. Not yet. How about you?
Kaufmann: Zip. But it's too soon to give up. This craziness can't go on forever. A Military Rescue Squad should be here any time now. If they come through the town, we're home free.
Harry: I hope so.
Kaufmann: I'd better get going. This isn't the time to stand around flapping our gums.
Harry: Do you know a girl called Alessa?
Kaufmann: No.
Harry: What's this! Uoh oh, huh?
Harry: Cybil!
Cybil: Harry!
Harry: How did you get back here?
Cybil: I followed the sewer. Were you the one who cut the fence?
Harry: Yeah. I'm glad you made it. I was worried about you.
Cybil: You were worried!? Where did you disappear to? Never mind. I want to know what's going on here. What is with this town?
Harry: This may sound really off the wall, but listen to me. You've got to believe me. I haven't gone crazy and I'm not fooling around. At first, I thought I was losing my mind. But now I know I'm not. It's not me. This whole town... it's being evaded by the Otherworld. A world of someone's nightmarish delusions come to life. Little by little, the evasion is spreading. Trying to swallow up everything in darkness. I think I'm finally beginning to understand what that lady was talking about.
Cybil: Harry. Hold on a minute. I don't get it.
Harry: Look, I don't understand it all myself. I guess I can't explain it.
Cybil: Well, what's making this happen?
Harry: I don't know that either. But I do know Cheryl is "there".
Cybil: There?
Harry: Under whoever created this darkness. Cheryl is somewhere and she needs my help.
Cybil: Harry, this whole thing's been a major blow to you. You need to rest.
Harry: Cybil, I---
Dahlia: The demon is awakening! Spreading those wings!
Harry: Dahlia Gillespie...
Dahlia: Was it not as I said? I see it all now. Yes, everything. Hungry for sacrifice, the demon will swallow up the land. I knew this day would come. And what's more, the task is almost finished. There's only two left, to seal this town to the abyss, the mark of Samael. When it is completed, all is lost. Even in daytime, darkness will cover the sun. The dead will walk, and martyrs will burn in the fires of hell! Everyone will DIE!
Harry: So what am I supposed to do!? I've got to save Cheryl.
Dahlia: It is simple. Stop the demon! The demon! The demon taking that child's form! Stop it before your daughter becomes a sacrifice. Before it is too late! Stop it. Stop it.
Harry: What do I do?
Dahlia: Go to the lighthouse on the lake, and to the center of the amusement park. Make haste, you are the only hope.
Cybil: Look Harry, I really don't get what's going on. But if there's a chance we can save your daughter, I'm in. I'll check out the amusment park, you go to the lighthouse.
Harry: Cybil, thanks.
Dahlia: You will need to use it.
Harry: Use what?
Dahlia: The Flauros. Only with that can you stop it.
Harry: What about Cybil!?
Harry: Wait! Damn! I was too late!
Harry: Cybil hasn't come back yet! That creep's sure to show up at the amusement part pretty soon. Let me be on time!
Harry: Cybil, wake up! Snap out of it! Cybil!
Cybil: Harry... what happened?
Harry: Shh... Don't talk, I'll take care of you.
Cybil: Harry... Why did they take your daughter? Why her?
Harry: I'm not sure myself. But, you know, Cheryl isn't my biological daughter. I actually haven't told her yet. She probably already knows anyway, though. We found her abandoned on the side of the highway. Nobody knew where she came from. We didn't have any kids of our own, my wife was sick, and it didn't look like she was getting any better. So we took Cheryl in.
Cybil: So in that case...
Harry: There might be some connection between Cheryl and this town.
Cybil: So what do you do now?
Harry: Cheryl is my daughter. I will save her no matter what.
Harry: I figured you'd show.
Harry: Hold it right there. I don't know who you are or what you're trying to do, and I don't care. Just one thing. Let Cheryl go. That's all I ask.
Harry: What?
Harry: Damn!
Harry: Huh? What is this?
Alessa: AHHH!!!!
Harry: Where's Cheryl? Give me back my daughter.
Dahlia: We meet at last, Alessa.
Alessa: Huh!
Harry: Dahlia Gillespie? Where's Cheryl? Where is she!?
Dahlia: Alessa, this is the end of your little game.
Alessa: Mama? Huh...
Harry: Could she be...
Dahlia: You've been a ghastly litle pest, haven't you Alessa? I was careless, thinking you couldn't escape from our spell. But Mommy didn't know how much you'd grown. That's why I couldn't catch you all by myself. But what a pity, yes? Now you're half indebted to this man for his help.
Harry: Hey, what are you talking about!?
Dahlia: Alessa, my dear little girl. There is one thing left that I need you to do for me.
Alessa: No! Get away from me!
Dahlia: Bad girl. Everything is ready. Let's go home now, uh-hmm...?
Harry: What's going on here!?
Alessa: OHH!!!!!
Lisa: Harry.
Harry: Lisa. What happened? Where's Alessa and Dahlia?
Lisa: Harry, listen. Something you said before has been bothering me. I just can't get it out of my head.
Harry: What is it, Lisa?
Lisa: So I went to look in the basement, even though I was scared as hell. Like you said, there were these creepy rooms. But nothing really unusual down there. But while I was down there I got this weird feeling. Like I'd been there before. Like something happened there, but I can't quite remember, somehow. What was it? Harry, help me. I'm so scared! I can't take this!
Harry: It's only a temporary thing. You're in shock from when you were knocked out. Don't fret about it. You'll remember after a while.
Lisa: No! You don't understand!
Harry: Wait! Where do you think you're going!?
Harry: I'm being summoned... What happened in this town? What could be making things like this? I have a feeling if I take the elevator down, I'll find it.
Harry: Cheryl...
Lisa: Harry?
Harry: Lisa... What's the matter with you?
Lisa: I get it now... Why I'm still alive even though everyone else is dead. I'm not the only one who's still walking around. I'm the same as them. I just hadn't noticed it before.
Harry: Lisa...
Lisa: Stay by me, Harry! Please. I'm so scared. Help me... Save me from
them! Please... Harry...
Harry: Huh!
Harry: Lisa...
Lisa: What is it? Still has an unusually high fever. Eyes don't open... Getting a pulse, but just barely breathing. I... Can't stand it any longer.
Dahlia: Everything is going according to plan. Sheltered in the womb.
Unknown Man: But it's not done yet. Half the soul is lost. That is why the seed lies dormant.
Doctor: But what so remains captured in that husk... is buried deep down in the subconscious.
Kaufmann: Are you trying to say it won't work? That wasn't our agreement!
Dahlia: No, no. These are just stalling tactics. If we lend a hand we will be able to get power. Never fear. The promise shall not be broken.
Unknown Man: But the power we could draw now would be very weak; almost nothing. Unless we get the other half of the soul...
Dahlia: We'll use a magical spell. Feeling this child's pain, it's sure to come.
Kaufmann: But that will take time.
Dahlia: Come on! Come on!
Alessa: No! No! I don't want to!
Dahlia: Do as mommy tells you, now. I just want you to lend me a teeny bit of your power, that's all.
Alessa: No! I don't want to do it!
Dahlia: It will make everyone happy... and it's for your own good too.
Alessa: No! But mommy, I just want to be with you. Just the two of us. Please understand.
Dahlia: You really mean it... Yes, I see. Maybe mommy has been wrong.
Alessa: Mommy...
Dahlia: Why didn't I see this before. There's no reason to wait. Herein lies the mother's womb. To obtain the power to create life. I could have done it all myself.
Alessa: Mommy!?
Dahlia: I was shocked to realize the talisman of Metraton was being used. In spite of the lost soul returning at last. Just a little longer and all would've been for naught.
Cybil: Freeze!
Cybil: What in the devil's name...!
Harry: Dahlia!
Dahlia: Well, well, well. To think you'd make it this far.
Harry: Where's Cheryl!? What have you done to her!?
Dahlia: What are you talking about? You've seen her many times. Restored to her former self.
Harry: I'm in no mood for jokes
Dahlia: Don't you see? She's right there.
Harry: That's absurd.
Dahlia: You are the only one who thinks so.
Harry: Why? Why are you doing this?
Dahlia: It's been a long seven years... For the seven years since that terrible day, Alessa has been kept alive, sufferring a fate worse than death. Alessa has been trapped in an endless nightmare, from which she never awakens.
Dahlia: My daughter will be the mother of God!
Kaufman: Quit screwing around! Return things to how they were before!
Harry: Kaufmann!
Kaufmann: Did I ask for this! Nobody uses me! You won't get away with this!
Dahlia: Your role is over. We don't need you anymore. What do you think you can accomplish by coming here?
Kaufmann: My, aren't we getting cocky? Bet you can't see this and keep your cool.
Dahlia: Aglaophotis! I thought I got rid of that!
Kaufmann: All I had to do was plant it somewhere for you to find. You all, well, it kept you busy. Ha! You're easy!
Dahlia: Stop it!!
Alessa + Cheryl: Ah!
Harry: Huh? What the!?
Kaufmann: What on earth? It's not supposed to...
Harry: Ah!
Voice: Daddy!
Kaufmann: Ah eh ahhhh........
Dahlia: I was shocked to realize the talisman of Metraton was being used. In spite of the lost soul returning at last. Just a little longer and all would've been for naught.
Cybil: Freeze!
Cybil: What in the devil's name...!
Harry: Dahlia!
Dahlia: Well, well, well. To think you'd make it this far.
Harry: Where's Cheryl!? What have you done to her!?
Dahlia: What are you talking about? You've seen her many times. Restored to her former self.
Harry: I'm in no mood for jokes
Dahlia: Don't you see? She's right there.
Harry: That's absurd.
Dahlia: You are the only one who thinks so.
Harry: Why? Why are you doing this?
Dahlia: It's been a long seven years... For the seven years since that terrible day, Alessa has been kept alive, sufferring a fate worse than death. Alessa has been trapped in an endless nightmare, from which she never awakens.
Dahlia: My daughter will be the mother of God!
Dahlia: It's awakening! It's awake!
Harry: Cheryl!!
Dahlia: Give up! That person no longer exists.
Voice: Daddy!
Harry: Cheryl!
Voice: Thank you daddy. Goodbye
Harry: Cheryl...? Can't be? You can't leave like this... This can't be happening! Cheryl? Cheryl!?
Cybil: Harry. Go.
