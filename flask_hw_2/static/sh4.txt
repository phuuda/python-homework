Henry: Oh, man...
Henry: What a dream...
Henry: It still doesn't work...
Henry: Hello...?
???: Help...me...
Henry: What...?
Henry: The cord's cut...
Henry: This chest could hold a lot of stuff.
Henry: Five days ago... That's when I first had the nightmare.
Henry: I haven't been able to get out of my room since then.
Henry: The phone doesn't work, the TV doesn't work... I can't even get anybody to hear me when I yell...
Henry: My whole world has suddenly turned insane...
Henry: My door's chained up, the windows are sealed shut...
Henry: And on top of that, someone chained the door from the inside.
Henry: How am I going to get out of here?
Henry: What the hell...?
Henry: What's goin' on here...?
Henry: That's Eileen Galvin from next door...
Eileen: Oh, man...
Eileen: Hope my luck changes before the party...
Henry: What was that?
Henry: What the hell?!
Henry: S-Somebody in there?
Henry: I wonder if I can get out this way...?
Henry: What...the...hell...?

???: It's Cynthia...
Henry: Your dream?
Cynthia: That's right. This is just a dream. And a really terrible one too.
Cynthia: I hope I wake up soon.
Henry: So you think this is a dream, huh?
Cynthia: Well, if it's not a dream, what is it?
Cynthia: Anyway, I want to get out of here, but I can't find the exit.
Cynthia: Say...
Cynthia: Will you help me find it?
Cynthia: I'm kinda scared all alone...
Cynthia: I'll do a "special favor" for you later...
Cynthia: It's just a dream, so I might as well have some fun...
Cynthia: Wait a minute...
Cynthia: I think I'm gonna puke...
Henry: What...another dream...?
Henry: But it seemed so real...
Henry: Or could it be...
Henry: Was I really inside that woman's dream...?
Henry: Oh, that's just stupid... What am I thinking...?
Henry: This furniture has been here since I moved in.
Henry: Huh...?
Henry: That's weird...
Henry: ...Somebody moved it...
Henry: Who could of done it...?
Eileen: ...Where did I put that damn broom...?

Cynthia: ...I...I feel like I'm dying...
Henry: It's okay...it's just a dream...

Henry: Help!
Eileen: Hey, Richard. Can you see anything from your window?
Richard: No...everything looks pretty normal to me...
Richard: The guy who lives here... What's he like, anyway?
Eileen: I know his name and face, but that's about it.
Richard: Well, I'm gonna go call the super.

Newscaster: A special news report... In a forest near Silent Hill, the burned corpse of a 30-year-old male was discovered earlier today.
Newscaster: The police have ruled it a homicide and are investigating.
Newscaster: The numbers "17121" were reportedly carved into the man's body.
Newscaster: Due to the marks on the victim, the police are investigating possible links to the Walter Sullivan case 10 years ago...
Frank: This is the superintendent! Are you in there, Henry?
Henry: Help me! There's something wrong with this room!
Henry: Help me Help! Let me outta here!
Frank: Is anybody home?
Henry: What's goin' on here...?
Frank: That's strange... It's the right key.
Frank: I'm...I'm...I'm sure I heard something in there...
Frank: Yeah, that sound...

Henry: Who is that boy?
Henry: And who are you?
???: His name's Walter...Walter Sullivan.
???: I used to work at the orphanage, watching the kids...
???: I'm Andrew DeSalvo.
Andrew: They tried to make it seem like an orphanage...
Andrew: But according to that town's Holy Scriptures, it was actually the center of their religion...
Andrew: That kid, Walter... He was really into that mumbo jumbo...
Andrew: Especially that "Descent of the Holy Mother" business...
Andrew: Scary... My God... Oh...oh, my God...
Eileen: How's it going with Room 302?
Frank: Well...I, uh, just tried to open it up,
Frank: but it looks like somethin's, uh...blockin' it from the inside.
Frank: Anyway, it's not the first time...
Eileen: You mean...the guy who lived here before...?
Frank: And it wasn't just him, either. There's, uh, somethin' wrong with this whole apartment...
Eileen: Don't say that... You're scaring me...
Frank: Well, anyway, I just slipped a note under his door.
Frank: Don't worry about it too much.
Frank: There are a...lot of strange things in this world...
Frank: The umbilical cord I keep in a box in my room...
Frank: Lately, it's started to smell terrible...
Eileen: Huh? Umbilical cord...?
Frank: Oh, forget I said anything...
Eileen: But still, those noises...
Richard: Ouch! Dammit...
Richard: Where the hell am I...?
Richard: Ah, you're a real person...
Richard: Hey, you're the guy that lives across from me...
Henry: Yeah, my name's Henry.
Richard: I'm Richard Braintree, from 207.
Richard: What the hell's happened to us?
Richard: That hole...and this freaky world...
Richard: But if you're here too...
Richard: then there must be something wrong with the whole apartment building...
Richard: That must explain what happened to that other guy too...
Henry: What "other guy"?
Richard: The guy who lived in 302 before you...
Richard: A journalist...he disappeared one day.
Richard: He got pretty crazy towards the end... Shut himself up in his room and wouldn't come out...
Richard: Anyway... I'm gettin' the hell out of here.
Richard: You should, too -- if you know what's good for you.
Henry: Wait...
Henry: Watch out for that kid.
Richard: Are you the kid he was talkin' about?
Richard: You live in that apartment too,
Richard: huh?
Richard: Say...you look a lot like a little punk that I once caught sneakin' around there...
Richard: Do you know somethin' about what's goin' on?!
Richard: Hey! Hey, you! Stop!
Richard: A...a...a...a...a...k...k...k..."kid"...!?
Richard: Th...th...th...th...that's n...n...no kid...
Richard: It's...th...the 11121...m...m...man...
Henry: There's a man in 207, pointing his finger...
Henry: He's pointing...at room 303... Eileen's room?
???: ..........
???: Looks like another one, captain...
???: ...got "1...121"... on his head...
???: It's just like that case from 10 years ago...
???: Yeah, that Walter Sullivan case...
???: But Sullivan's dead. They even got the body...
???: Must be some crazy copycat...
???: Yeah, but even so...
Henry: It looks like my apartment...
Henry: What the hell is this?
???: I got this from Miss Galvin a long, long time ago...
???: She was younger than me back then... She looked so happy holding her mother's hand...
???: Here, I'll give it to you...
Eileen: Hey kid...
Eileen: Thanks...
Eileen: Did you find your mommy...?
Eileen: This place...it's dangerous...
Eileen: You need... Hurry and get out of here...
Henry: Eileen...
Henry: The hole...
Henry: Where will it lead to this time...?
Henry: Eileen... I wonder she's okay...
Henry: Eileen... Are you still alive...?
Henry: Eileen... (not written).
Eileen: Aaaaah!
Henry: Eileen! Eileen! Relax!
Eileen: Y-You... You're Henry from next door...
Eileen: ...What are you doing here?
Henry: I don't...I don't know where to start...
Henry: There was this strange hole in my room...
Henry: I saw people getting killed...all these weird other worlds...
Henry: And I saw you get attacked too...
Eileen: What are you talking about? I'm supposed to believe that?
Henry: But it's true... And there was a kid with you...
Eileen: I remember now.
Eileen: I was getting ready to go to my friend's party...
Eileen: The boy protected me from the man with the coat...
Eileen: I'm sorry I didn't believe you...
Eileen: I guess there's something wrong with me...
Eileen: I just feel so scared...
Eileen: This place...what is it anyway?
Henry: I don't know either...
Henry: But I do know that if you get killed here...
Henry: Then you die in the real world too...
Henry: Anyway, the only out of here is through that hole.
Henry: Okay, okay. Take me with you.
Eileen: This is a nightmare... It can't be happening...
Henry: Eileen...she's gone.....
Eileen: Henry!
Henry: Have you been here the whole time?
Eileen: Yeah, and I didn't see any hole either. You just disappeared all of a sudden.
Eileen: I can't stay here by myself. I'll be cursed... I know it...
Eileen: What am I gonna do?
Henry: I might know a way to save you...
Henry: Do you know about someone named Joseph?
Eileen: Yeah, he was the guy who lived in your apartment before you.
Eileen: I think he was a journalist or something.
Eileen: He disappeared about 6 months before you moved in...
Eileen: But towards the end...
Eileen: He started acting really weird.....
Henry: Yeah, he was doing an investigation...
Henry: About a religious cult and a man named Walter Sullivan.
Henry: I got this letter from him...
Henry: He told me to go down... down into the deepest part of him...
Henry: And to look for the ultimate Truth.
Henry: Let's do that. There must be something down there.
Eileen: Okay, I'll do it. You're the only chance I've got...
Eileen: I'll stick with you.
Eileen: I wonder if Joseph is still alive...
Eileen: This looks like South Ashfield Station...
Eileen: I can't use a ladder with my arm like this...
Eileen: What is this place?
Henry: Are you...Walter Sullivan?
Walter: That's what everybody calls me, but I don't really have a name.
Walter: Or a home either...
Henry: Well, what about a mom or dad?
Walter: Yeah...but I never met 'em...
Walter: They left South Ashfield Heights right after I was born.
Walter: But soon I'll get to see my mom.
Henry: Do you know where she is now?
Walter: Yeah, of course -- right where I was born.
Walter: Lots of people tried to stop me, but it's fine now.
Walter: It says in the Scriptures that I'll be with her.
Walter: I gotta hurry. Mom's waiting...
Eileen: Could this be...Silent Hill Woods...?
Eileen: This is just horrible.
Eileen: It's so damp and gross in here...
Eileen: Could this be Silent Hill Cult...?
Eileen: The place where they kept all those kids locked up...?
Young Walter: I'm going to see my mom! Stay outta my way!
Young Walter: Who are you, anyway?
Walter: My name's Walter. Walter Sullivan.
Walter: It's time to complete the "21 Sacraments."
Young Walter: But that's my name... And what are the "21 Sacraments"?
Walter: Don't worry. You'll know soon enough.
Walter: Well, let's go and see Mother...
Henry: Damn!
Eileen: I remember this place... It looks a lot like downtown Ashfield.
Operator: The phone number you are trying to reach is no longer in service.
Operator: The new number is 555-4890.
Eileen: I wonder what could be down here...
Eileen: It's him...
Joseph: You've done well to make it this far.
Joseph: Let me tell you something about "him," Walter Sullivan...
Joseph: When he was a little boy, he began to believe that my apartment was actually his birth mother.
Joseph: He decided to "free" her from the stains and corruption of this world.
Joseph: At the orphanage, he learned of the "21 Sacraments," the only way to purify her.
Joseph: He then performed the ceremony of the "Holy Assumption" and created this...twisted world.
Joseph: Now...he's become nothing more than an inhuman killing machine...
Joseph: Well, he's dead now...but he's trying to complete...the "21 Sacraments."
Joseph: His boyhood desire...to return to the bosom of his birth...has divided him...
Joseph: Now his child self...has manifested itself in this world...
Joseph: And soon, he is planning to finish his work...
Joseph: The...21...Sacraments...
Joseph: Number 20... "The Mother Reborn"... Eileen Galvin...
Joseph: Number 21... "The Receiver of Wisdom"... Henry Townshend...
Joseph: Even now...it may not be...too late...
Joseph: Follow the...Crimson Tome... Stop him...
Joseph: If not...wherever you run... He will catch you...
Joseph: Find...him... His...true location...
Joseph: It must be nearby... You must kill...him...
Joseph: You must kill him...
Joseph: Kill...... Kill...
Joseph: Kill...... Kill......
Joseph: Hurry...
Joseph: She's being taken over... She's Number 20... "The Mother Reborn"...
Joseph: The Crimson Tome...
Joseph: Obey the Crimson Tome...
Joseph: Kill him... Must...kill...him...
Joseph: Kill...... Kill......
Joseph: Kill...... Kill...
Henry: No way...
Henry: Not here too...
Henry: Eileen!
Eileen: This is our apartment building, but...now it looks like some kind of nightmare.
Henry: Eileen...?
Eileen: It's terrible... That poor little boy...
Eileen: His parents just threw him away right after he was born...
Eileen: Poor thing...
Eileen: He really thinks that Room 302 is his mother...
Eileen: I've gotta...I've gotta help him...
Henry: Ow, my head......!
Eileen: Henry? Are you okay?
Eileen: It's Walter... He's crying...
Eileen: Even finishing the 21 Sacraments... It won't help that boy...
Eileen: I'm going back, Henry... To the room where he is...
Eileen: We're the only ones... The only ones that can stop him.
Young Walter: Mom! Mom!
Young Walter: Let me in...
Young Walter: Mom!
Walter: Hey there, little Walter... Just a little longer now...
Walter: Henry...
Walter: You're it...the last of the 21 Sacraments...
Walter: The "Final Sign"...
Walter: The "Receiver of Wisdom."
Walter: Mom... (he repeats once more only it is not written).
Henry: Ah! My head (not written but I think it's intentional)
Young Walter: Mom...
Young Walter: Mom......
Young Walter: I'm home...
Young Walter: I won't let anyone get in my way...
Young Walter: I'm gonna stay with you, forever......
